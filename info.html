            <h4>Meeting Time</h4>
            <pre>M 07:00-09:45PM. SHAN 3485</pre>

            <h4>Course Description</h4>
            <p>
                This course is designed to fill the linear algebra background of students to a graduate level.
                To complement this theory, emphasis on applications in various areas is intended to allow students
                to bring this knowledge to their own application area. Application areas include: machine learning,
                convex optimization, compressed sensing, and randomized data compression, among others.
            </p>

            <h4>Structure</h4>
            <p>
                We will loosely follow our textbook at a rate of around one chapter a week to ensure continuity
                and make sure every student can fill their mathematical background and speak the <em>language</em>
                of linear algebra and matrix analysis. In order to achieve fluency using this language in practice,
                a significant portion of our course will be devoted to applications of the theory of linear algebra
                and matrix analysis, sometimes from the text, sometimes not. Contrary to the nomenclature, some of these
                applications will be quite rich mathematically. Homework will follow this split model
                as well, with roughly half of the problems covering theory and half covering applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Homework</h4>
            <p>
                Problem sets will be due (virtually) every week, on Monday outside Professor Gu's office.
                Usually there will be 4 problems per week. At least half of the problems from the course will come
                from the text. Occasionally problems will require coding.
                For this we recommend either Python (using <a href="numpy.org">numpy</a> and <a href="scipy.org">scipy</a>) or
                Matlab, but feel free to use whatever works for you.
            </p>

            <h4>Midterm Project</h4>
            <p>
                Details given in class, but this will reflect the final project in nature. If the final project
                is to be a continuation of the midterm project (which is expected), significant additional progress
                must be made.
            </p>

            <a name="final-project"></a>
            <h4>Final Project</h4>
            <p>
                The final project is intended to give students, in groups of 2-3, the opportunity to deep-dive
                into a specific area of
                interest in linear algebra or matrix analysis. This could be theoretical or applied, but in both cases
                should be originated from a single question. For example, such questions might be:
                <ul>
                    <li>How close should random matrices be to their mean?</li>
                    <li>How can we estimate the spectral norm of a matrix using limited space?</li>
                    <li>Which properties of matrices can we approximate only by testing a few inputs?</li>
                    <li>Which/can Banach spaces look like Hilbert Space?</li>
                    <li>How can large scale linear system solvers from numerical linear algebra be used to speed up kernel methods?</li>
                </ul>
                This motivating question will be turned in as the single sentence alone, typed and stapled onto the back
                of their midterm project. Students
                are encouraged to discuss their ideas with teaching staff before committing to a question.
                Staff can also help students less fluent in the field to find topics that might intersect
                their interests. Questions should be quite focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                About a month after proposing their initial question, students will submit a literature review
                of work that attempts to answer their question. This will be at <em>most</em> four pages in article class
                LaTeX, one inch margins, not including references. The review should include important definitions,
                discuss the body of work surrounding the question. At the top of the paper, as an abstract, the
                student should include a refined version of their motivating question.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the course, students are expected to continue investigating their question.
                In particular, students should be able to find a concrete open problem in the area
                or blind spot in the research body. (Hint: look at the end of recent papers).
                Open problems can be empirical (e.g. investigating the geometry of neural network loss surfaces
                through the spectral information in the Hessians), applied (e.g. finding efficient algorithms
                for estimating the L-p norm of an operator with limited space), or theoretical (e.g. characterizing
                the distortion of embedding L-p into L-2 for different p).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the end of the course, using this prior work on the project, the student will
                create a paper of at <em>least</em> 12 pages that details the background and progress of the research body
                on their open problem, promising directions, and demonstrations of results (computations or proofs).
                If the student is able to solve or even make concrete progress towards the open problem they will
                get an A on the final paper. Otherwise, experimental evidence towards their open problem is expected.
                The group will also give a presentation of at most 15 minutes detailing this adventure.
