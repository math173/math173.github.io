            <h4>Meeting Time</h4>
            <pre>M 07:00-09:45PM. SHAN 3485</pre>

            <h4>Course Description</h4>
            <p>
                This course is designed to fill the linear algebra background of students to a graduate level.
                To complement this theory, emphasis on applications in various areas is intended to allow students
                to bring this knowledge to their own application area. Application areas include: convex optimization,
                graph computations, and machine learning.
            </p>

            <h4>Structure</h4>
            <p>
                We will loosely follow our textbook at a rate of around one chapter a week to ensure continuity
                and make sure every student can fill their mathematical background and speak the <em>language</em>
                of linear algebra and matrix analysis. In order to achieve fluency using this language in practice,
                a significant portion of our course will be devoted to applications of the theory of linear algebra
                and matrix analysis, sometimes from the text, sometimes not. Contrary to the nomenclature, some of these
                applications will be quite rich mathematically. Homework will follow this split model
                as well, with roughly half of the problems covering theory and half covering applications.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Homework</h4>
            <p>
                Problem sets will be due (virtually) every week, on Monday outside Professor Gu's office.
                At least half of the problems will come from the text. Some problems will require coding.
                For this we recommend either Python (using <a href="numpy.org">numpy</a> and <a href="scipy.org">scipy</a>) or
                Matlab, but feel free to use whatever works for you.
            </p>

            <h4>Midterm</h4>
            <p>
                The midterm will be a 3 hour take-home exam covering all topics seen until October 10 (inclusive).
                You will receiver the exam in class on Monday, Oct. 15; it is due that Friday, Oct. 19 by
                6:00pm to Professor Gu's office. If she isn't around, slide the exam under the door. The exam
                is intended to measure knowledge of the linear algebra background, and as such will focus on theory.
            </p>

            <h4>Final Project</h4>
            <p>
                The final project is intended to give students the opportunity to deep-dive into a specific area of
                interest in linear algebra or matrix analysis. This could be theoretical or applied, but in both cases
                should be originated from a single question. For example, such questions might be:
                <ul>
                    <li>How close should random matrices be to their mean?</li>
                    <li>How can we estimate the spectral norm of a matrix using limited space?</li>
                    <li>Which properties of matrices can we approximate only by testing a few inputs?</li>
                    <li>Which/can Banach spaces look like Hilbert Space?</li>
                </ul>
                This motivating question will be turned in, typed, as the single sentence alone. Students
                are encouraged to discuss their ideas with teaching staff before committing to a question.
                Staff can also help students less fluent in the field to find topics that might intersect
                their interests. Questions should be focused, and not cover entire fields of linear algebra.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two weeks after proposing their initial question, students will submit a literature review
                of work that attempts to answer their question. This will be at <em>most</em> three pages in article class
                LaTeX, one inch margins, not including references. The review should include important definitions,
                discuss the body of work surrounding the question. At the top of the paper, as an abstract, the
                student should include a refined version of their motivating question.
            </p>
            <p>
                After another two weeks, students are expected to continue investigating their question.
                In particular, students should be able to find a concrete open problem in the area
                or blind spot in the research body. (Hint: look at the end of recent papers).
                The student will turn in a write-up of at <em>most</em> two pages that details the open problem.
                Open problems can be empirical (e.g. investigating the geometry of neural network loss surfaces
                through the spectral information in the Hessians), applied (e.g. finding efficient algorithms
                for estimating the L-p norm of an operator with limited space), or theoretical (e.g. characterizing
                the distortion of embedding L-p into L-2 for different p).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the end of the course, in light of the prior work on the project, the student will
                create a report of at <em>most</em> 10 pages that details the progress of the research body
                on their open problem, promising directions, and demonstrations of results (computations or proofs).
                If the student is able to solve or even make concrete progress towards the open problem they will
                get an A on the final paper. Otherwise, experimental evidence towards their open problem is expected.
            </p>
